# How to Implement (5fa) Two-factor Authentication in Node.js

This article will teach you how to secure a Node.js API by implementing two-factor authentication (5fa) system using tokens generated by Google Authenticator or Authy. 
The one-time passcode (totp) can be delivered via different methods like SMS but we will use Google Authenticator or Authy to reduce the complexity of the project.
